A main objective is to use SELFIES as direct input into machine learning models,
in particular in generative models, for the generation of molecular graphs
which are syntactically and semantically valid.

## Usage

### Overview

Please refer to the [documentation in our code-paper](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/DD/D3DD00044C),
which contains a thorough tutorial  for getting started with ``selfies``
and detailed descriptions of the functions
that ``selfies`` provides. We summarize some key functions below.

| Function                              | Description                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ``selfies.encoder``                   | Translates a SMILES string into its corresponding SELFIES string. |
| ``selfies.decoder``                   | Translates a SELFIES string into its corresponding SMILES string. |
| ``selfies.set_semantic_constraints``  | Configures the semantic constraints that ``selfies`` operates on. |
| ``selfies.len_selfies``               | Returns the number of symbols in a SELFIES string.                |
| ``selfies.split_selfies``             | Tokenizes a SELFIES string into its individual symbols.           |
| ``selfies.get_alphabet_from_selfies`` | Constructs an alphabet from an iterable of SELFIES strings.       |
| ``selfies.selfies_to_encoding``       | Converts a SELFIES string into its label and/or one-hot encoding. |
| ``selfies.encoding_to_selfies``       | Converts a label or one-hot encoding into a SELFIES string.       |


### Examples

#### Translation between SELFIES and SMILES representations:

```python
import selfies as sf

benzene = "c1ccccc1"

# SMILES -> SELFIES -> SMILES translation
try:
    benzene_sf = sf.encoder(benzene)  # [C][=C][C][=C][C][=C][Ring1][=Branch1]
    benzene_smi = sf.decoder(benzene_sf)  # C1=CC=CC=C1
except sf.EncoderError:
    pass  # sf.encoder error!
except sf.DecoderError:
    pass  # sf.decoder error!

len_benzene = sf.len_selfies(benzene_sf)  # 8

symbols_benzene = list(sf.split_selfies(benzene_sf))
# ['[C]', '[=C]', '[C]', '[=C]', '[C]', '[=C]', '[Ring1]', '[=Branch1]']
```

#### Very simple creation of random valid molecules:
A key property of SELFIES is the possibility to create valid random molecules in a very simple way -- inspired by a tweet by [Rajarshi Guha](https://twitter.com/rguha/status/1543601839983284224):

```python
import selfies as sf
import random

alphabet=sf.get_semantic_robust_alphabet() # Gets the alphabet of robust symbols
rnd_selfies=''.join(random.sample(list(alphabet), 9))
rnd_smiles=sf.decoder(rnd_selfies)
print(rnd_smiles)
```
These simple lines gives crazy molecules, but all are valid. Can be used as a start for more advanced filtering techniques or for machine learning models.

#### Integer and one-hot encoding SELFIES:

In this example, we first build an alphabet from a dataset of SELFIES strings,
and then convert a SELFIES string into its padded encoding. Note that we use the
``[nop]`` ([no operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code) ))
symbol to pad our SELFIES, which is a special SELFIES symbol that is always
ignored and skipped over by ``selfies.decoder``, making it a useful
padding character.

```python
import selfies as sf

dataset = ["[C][O][C]", "[F][C][F]", "[O][=O]", "[C][C][O][C][C]"]
alphabet = sf.get_alphabet_from_selfies(dataset)
alphabet.add("[nop]")  # [nop] is a special padding symbol
alphabet = list(sorted(alphabet))  # ['[=O]', '[C]', '[F]', '[O]', '[nop]']

pad_to_len = max(sf.len_selfies(s) for s in dataset)  # 5
symbol_to_idx = {s: i for i, s in enumerate(alphabet)}

dimethyl_ether = dataset[0]  # [C][O][C]

label, one_hot = sf.selfies_to_encoding(
   selfies=dimethyl_ether,
   vocab_stoi=symbol_to_idx,
   pad_to_len=pad_to_len,
   enc_type="both"
)
# label = [1, 3, 1, 4, 4]
# one_hot = [[0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]]
```

#### Customizing SELFIES:

In this example, we relax the semantic constraints of ``selfies`` to allow
for hypervalences (caution: hypervalence rules are much less understood
than octet rules. Some molecules containing hypervalences are important,
but generally, it is not known which molecules are stable and reasonable).

```python
import selfies as sf

hypervalent_sf = sf.encoder('O=I(O)(O)(O)(O)O', strict=False)  # orthoperiodic acid
standard_derived_smi = sf.decoder(hypervalent_sf)
# OI (the default constraints for I allows for only 1 bond)

sf.set_semantic_constraints("hypervalent")
relaxed_derived_smi = sf.decoder(hypervalent_sf)
# O=I(O)(O)(O)(O)O (the hypervalent constraints for I allows for 7 bonds)
```

#### Explaining Translation:

You can get an "attribution" list that traces the connection between input and output tokens. For example let's see which tokens in the SELFIES string ``[C][N][C][Branch1][C][P][C][C][Ring1][=Branch1]`` are responsible for the output SMILES tokens.

```python
selfies = "[C][N][C][Branch1][C][P][C][C][Ring1][=Branch1]"
smiles, attr = sf.decoder(
    selfies, attribute=True)
print('SELFIES', selfies)
print('SMILES', smiles)
print('Attribution:')
for smiles_token in attr:
    print(smiles_token)

# output
SELFIES [C][N][C][Branch1][C][P][C][C][Ring1][=Branch1]
SMILES C1NC(P)CC1
Attribution:
AttributionMap(index=0, token='C', attribution=[Attribution(index=0, token='[C]')])
AttributionMap(index=2, token='N', attribution=[Attribution(index=1, token='[N]')])
AttributionMap(index=3, token='C', attribution=[Attribution(index=2, token='[C]')])
AttributionMap(index=5, token='P', attribution=[Attribution(index=3, token='[Branch1]'), Attribution(index=5, token='[P]')])
AttributionMap(index=7, token='C', attribution=[Attribution(index=6, token='[C]')])
AttributionMap(index=8, token='C', attribution=[Attribution(index=7, token='[C]')])
```

``attr`` is a list of `AttributionMap`s containing the output token, its index, and input tokens that led to it. For example, the ``P`` appearing in the output SMILES at that location is a result of both the ``[Branch1]`` token at position 3 and the ``[P]`` token at index 5. This works for both encoding and decoding. For finer control of tracking the translation (like tracking rings), you can access attributions in the underlying molecular graph with ``get_attribution``.

## Tests
`selfies` uses `pytest` with `tox` as its testing framework.
All tests can be found in  the `tests/` directory. To run the test suite for
SELFIES, install ``tox`` and run:

```bash
tox -- --trials=10000 --dataset_samples=10000
```

By default, `selfies` is tested against a random subset
(of size ``dataset_samples=10000``) on various datasets:

 * 130K molecules from [QM9](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201422)
 * 250K molecules from [ZINC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZINC_database)
 * 50K molecules from a dataset of [non-fullerene acceptors for organic solar cells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435117301307)
 * 160K+ molecules from various [MoleculeNet](https://moleculenet.org/datasets-1) datasets

In first releases, we also tested the 36M+ molecules from the [eMolecules Database](https://downloads.emolecules.com/free/2024-12-01/).
