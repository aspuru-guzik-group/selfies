    The SELFIES to SMILES translation operates based on the :mod:`selfies`
    grammar rules, which can be configured using
    :func:`selfies.set_semantic_constraints`. Given the appropriate settings,
    the decoded SMILES will always be syntactically and semantically correct.
    That is, the output SMILES will satisfy the specified bond constraints.
    Additionally, :func:`selfies.decoder` will attempt to preserve the
    atom and branch order of the input SELFIES.

    :param selfies: the SELFIES to be translated.
    :param print_error: if True, error messages will be printed to console.
        Defaults to False.
    :param constraints: if ``'octet_rule'`` or ``'hypervalent'``,
        the corresponding preset bond constraints will be used instead.
        If ``None``, :func:`selfies.decoder` will use the
        currently configured bond constraints. Defaults to ``None``.
    :return: the SMILES translation of ``selfies``. If an error occurs,
        and ``selfies`` cannot be translated, ``None`` is returned instead.

    :Example:

    >>> import selfies
    >>> selfies.decoder('[C][=C][F]')
